*This's an endless animation written on JavaScipt, where predators in the form of small cubes eat mammals. A plane is flying and throwing bombs exploding everything in its path. In addition, there is a small snake that also eats mammals.* 

Here used free and open-source p5.js JavaScript library for drawing functionality.
